# Description

A simple Spring Boot app that configures

- Https on port 8080 listening on 0.0.0.0 
  - without SslBundle, using trustAllCertsTrustManagers and NoopHostnameVerifier.
  - with `SslBundle` named `server` that wraps `server1.jks` keystore.
- Http on port `loopback.http.port` listening on 127.0.0.1 only when running a embedded Tomcat

Accesses each using `RestClient` instances, one of which is configured with `SslBundle` named `client` that wraps `server1-truststore.jks` truststore.
